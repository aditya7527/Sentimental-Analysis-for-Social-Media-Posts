# Sentimental-Analysis-for-Social-Media-Posts
Sentiment Analysis Project
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model. It analyzes text data to classify sentiments as positive or negative, showcasing a simple yet effective approach to sentiment classification.

Features
1)Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and filtering of non-alphanumeric tokens using NLTK.
2)TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical features for machine learning.
3)Logistic Regression Classifier: A trained model to predict the sentiment of input text.
4)Customizable Tests: Easily test the model with your own input text.
Libraries Used
NLTK: For text tokenization and stopword removal.
NumPy: For handling numerical data.
scikit-learn: For feature extraction (TF-IDF) and the Logistic Regression model.
