# Sentimental-Analysis-for-Social-Media-Posts
Sentiment Analysis Project
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model. It analyzes text data to classify sentiments as positive or negative, showcasing a simple yet effective approach to sentiment classification.
# Features 
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization of input text.
Removal of stopwords.
Filtering out non-alphanumeric tokens.
TF-IDF Vectorization:
Converts text data into numerical features for machine learning.
Logistic Regression Classifier:
A trained model to predict the sentiment of input text.
Customizable Tests:
Allows easy testing of the model with your own input text.
# Libraries Used
NLTK: For text tokenization and stopword removal.
NumPy: For handling numerical data.
scikit-learn: For feature extraction (TF-IDF) and the Logistic Regression model.
