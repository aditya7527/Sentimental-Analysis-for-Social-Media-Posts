# Sentimental-Analysis-for-Social-Media-Posts
Sentiment Analysis Project
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model. It analyzes text data to classify sentiments as positive or negative, showcasing a simple yet effective approach to sentiment classification.
# Features 
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization of input text  

Removal of stopwords.
Filtering out non-alphanumeric tokens.

TF-IDF Vectorization:
Converts text data into numerical features for machine learning.

Logistic Regression Classifier:
A trained model to predict the sentiment of input text.

# Customizable Tests:
Allows easy testing of the model with your own input text.

# Libraries Used
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):

Used for text preprocessing tasks like tokenization (splitting text into words), removing stop words (common words like "the", "a", "is"), and potentially stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form).

NumPy:

Used for numerical operations, especially for handling arrays and matrices, which are essential for representing text data in a format suitable for machine learning models.


scikit-learn (sklearn):

Used for building and training the machine learning model. Specifically:
TfidfVectorizer: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique, which represents the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents.
LogisticRegression: The machine learning model used for sentiment classification.
#  How To Run 
Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the dependencies:
```ruby
pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn
```

2) Download NLTK Resources:
If running for the first time, the script automatically downloads the necessary NLTK resources.
```ruby
import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords') 
```
3) Prepare Your Dataset:

Replace the sample dataset in the notebook with your own data.
Ensure your dataset is in a format where each data point has text and its corresponding sentiment label (e.g., 1 for positive, 0 for negative).

4) Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the Jupyter Notebook (sentiment_analysis.ipynb) in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, etc.).
Execute all the cells in the notebook sequentially. This will:
Preprocess the text data.
Train the Logistic Regression model.
Make predictions on new text samples.

Elaboration on Steps:

Install Required Libraries: This step ensures that you have the necessary Python libraries installed to run the code.
Download NLTK Resources: NLTK uses data like stop words and tokenizers that need to be downloaded. This step downloads those data files.
Prepare Your Dataset: You'll want to use your own dataset for more relevant sentiment analysis.
Run the Jupyter Notebook: This is how you execute the code in the notebook.

# Example in README.md:
 ##How to Run

1. **Install Required Libraries:**

bash pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn

2. **Download NLTK Resources:**

python import nltk nltk.download('punkt') nltk.download('stopwords')

3. **Prepare Your Dataset:**
    - Create a CSV file named 'your_data.csv' with two columns: 'text' and 'sentiment'.
    - The 'text' column should contain the text data you want to analyze.
    - The 'sentiment' column should contain the corresponding sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
    - Replace 'your_data.csv' with the actual file name if it's different.
    - **Example 'your_data.csv':**

4. **Test Sentiment:**
Input custom text to classify its sentiment.
 test case 
```ruby
   text,sentiment
   
   This movie was amazing!,1
   
   I hated the ending.,0
   
   The plot was so interesting.,1

```
# Example Usage
Input 
```ruby
"This is a fantastic project!"
```
Output 
```ruby
The sentiment of the text is positive.
```

# Important Considerations:

Data Format: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted to be loaded into the code. Provide clear instructions in the "How to Run" section if any specific format is required.

Error Handling: If there are potential errors that users might encounter (e.g., missing files or data format issues), include instructions on how to troubleshoot them.

Environment: If your project requires a specific environment setup, such as specific Python versions or package dependencies, mention it in the "How to Run" section.

Dataset Loading: If you provide a sample dataset, update the code to load your actual dataset when users want to analyze their own data. Make this clear in the instructions.

Remember to replace placeholders (like file names and dataset details) with your actual information. By providing clear and detailed instructions, you make it easier for others to understand and run your project. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
